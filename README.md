## About ##
This page is designed to provide insights on some of the distressing methods that I personally found helpful, so others could perhaps get some ideas. To be honest, this is for my compsci homework..but I enjoyed sharing thoughts on this topic :)


## Music ##
Music has always been my trusted ally in the battle against stress. Lyrics and melodies of the music can instantly transport anyone to a place of calm and serenity - with a little help of earphones. When you feel overwhelmed by the people, school work, future plans, and more, just let the music take control and take your time of relief. It’s as if the stress and worries melt away, replaced by a sense of tranquility and emotional relief. I personally like to play along with the song with either piano or violin, as much as I love listening to music. When I try to discover how to play the full song - only by hearing - it takes me to another world where no worries exist.
Remember: Even in the midst of chaos, there’s a melody of peace waiting for anyone who needs it.

## Journal ##
![Pictures of journals I have used so far](journals.png)
I have actually started journaling way before I really started to listen to music all the time. First time I ever wrote a journal was when I was in 4th grade, as I immigrated to the United States with my family. At the time, there wasn't really anyone to share my concerns, because I didn't want to raise additional worries to my parents and my younger brother, who was also going through a hard time like me. Personally, putting pen to paper allows me to untangle the jumbled mess of thoughts and emotions in my mind. It’s like giving voice to my inner turmoil. Over time, this practice has made me more self-aware and better equipped to manage stress. Research also suggests that journaling helps reduce stress by promoting self-reflection and emotiaonl processing.

## Miniature ##
With the pandemic came endless free time, which made me more space to store my concerns. In order to minimize this time, I searched for something new to take up myself. I started to make miniatures, with first one being a _Tea Garden_[^1]. Later, as I continued to do this for a couple of years, I realized that it was helping with stress. The meticulous process of crafting these tiny worlds allows me to escape the chaos of everyday life and immerse myself in a world of creativity and focus. As I painstakingly assemble miniature furniture or build intricate landscapes, my mind shifts away from worries and stressors. When I gaze upon the finished miniature, it brings a huge satisfaction and joy.

## Meditation ##
While I haven't made meditation a regular practice, I've heard how profoundly it can help with stress, and there's solid science to back it up. Meditation is like a mental gym for relaxation, honing your mind's ability to focus and remain calm. The scientific reasoning behind this is that meditation triggers the relaxation response, which reduces the production of stress hormones like cortisol. Even though I'm not a regular practitioner, I've tried meditation with calm music on, in which I was able to feel peace. It's quite incredible how just a few minutes of quiet contemplation can reset the mind.

Some well-known meditation apps to give a try:

## Author's Note ##
These practices have been my personal anchors in turbulent times, but it's essential to remember that there's no one-size-fits-all solution for stress. Each individual is unique, and the path to relaxation is a highly personal journey. Whether it's nature walks, yoga, cooking, or any other activity that brings you peace, the options are as diverse as we are. Embrace the freedom to explore, and let your heart guide you to your own oasis of calm. Countless threads await your discovery; all you need to do is to click a search button.
