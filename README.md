## **Unwind Mind**
This page is designed to provide insights on some of the de-stressing methods that I personally found helpful, so others could perhaps get some ideas. To be honest, this is for my compsci homework..
### Music
Music has always been my trusted ally in the battle against stress. Lyrics and melodies of the music can instantly transport anyone to a place of calm and serenity - with a little help of earphones. When you feel overwhelmed by the people, school work, future plans, and more, just let the music take control and take your time of relief. It’s as if the stress and worries melt away, replaced by a sense of tranquility and emotional relief. I personally like to play along with the song with either piano or violin, as much as I love listening to music. When I try to discover how to play the full song - only by hearing - it takes me to another world where no worries exist.
Remember: Even in the midst of chaos, there’s a melody of peace waiting for anyone who needs it.
